# MCP Flow - Project Progress Report

## Project Overview
MCP Flow is a visual interface for discovering, managing, and installing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers from GitHub. The application uses React Flow for the visual interface and integrates with the MCP SDK for server management.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Setup
- âœ… Created basic project structure
- âœ… Set up TypeScript configuration
- âœ… Configured Webpack for development
- âœ… Added necessary dependencies (React, React Flow, MCP SDK)

### 2. Core Components
- âœ… Created App.tsx with React Flow integration
- âœ… Implemented basic node structure
- âœ… Set up styles.css for visual styling
- âœ… Created type definitions for MCP interfaces

### 3. MCP Integration
- âœ… Created mcp-bridge.ts for MCP SDK integration
- âœ… Defined types for MCP server interactions
- âœ… Implemented search and install functionality

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. SDK Integration Issues
- ðŸ”´ Initial attempt to use @modelcontextprotocol/sdk directly failed due to import issues
- ðŸ”´ Tried multiple approaches:
  - Direct SDK import (failed)
  - HTTP API approach (abandoned)
  - Global use_mcp_tool declaration (current approach)

### 2. Development Environment
- ðŸ”´ Node.js version compatibility issues with some dependencies
- ðŸ”´ Webpack configuration needed adjustments for Node.js polyfills
- ðŸ”´ Development server port conflicts

### 3. TypeScript Configuration
- ðŸ”´ Issues with type declarations for MCP tools
- ðŸ”´ Required additional configuration for global type declarations

## Lessons Learned
1. MCP SDK integration requires careful consideration of the execution environment
2. Browser-based MCP tools need different handling than Node.js-based tools
3. TypeScript configuration is crucial for proper type checking and IDE support
4. Webpack configuration needs special attention for Node.js modules in browser

## Recent Updates

### 1. UI Enhancements
- âœ… Added modern GitHub-style modal for server details
- âœ… Implemented keyboard navigation (Esc to close)
- âœ… Added loading states and visual feedback
- âœ… Improved hover effects and transitions
- âœ… Added backdrop blur and animations

### 2. Search Interface
- âœ… Implemented search interface for GitHub MCP servers
- âœ… Added loading and empty states
- âœ… Added error handling for search operations
- âœ… Improved search results display

### 3. Installation Flow
- âœ… Added visual feedback for installation process
- âœ… Implemented loading states for install button
- âœ… Added error handling for installation
- âœ… Improved installation status indicators

## Next Steps

### 1. React Flow Integration
- [ ] Enhance node customization
- [ ] Improve node layout algorithms
- [ ] Add node grouping functionality
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop features

### 2. Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Add setup instructions

### 3. Advanced Features
- [ ] Add server version tracking
- [ ] Implement server update notifications
- [ ] Add server dependency visualization
- [ ] Implement server health monitoring

## Technical Improvements
1. âœ… Organized styles with proper comments and sections
2. âœ… Added TypeScript types for all components
3. âœ… Improved error handling throughout the application
4. âœ… Optimized webpack configuration

## Timeline
1. React Flow enhancements (2-3 days)
2. Testing implementation (2-3 days)
3. Documentation (1-2 days)
4. Advanced features (3-4 days)

## Success Criteria
1. âœ… Users can search for MCP servers on GitHub
2. âœ… Servers are visually represented with GitHub-style cards
3. âœ… Installation process provides clear feedback
4. âœ… UI is intuitive and responsive
5. âœ… Error handling is robust and user-friendly
6. [ ] Node relationships are clearly visualized
7. [ ] Server health status is easily monitored

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
1. âœ… MCP SDK compatibility - Resolved with proper error handling
2. âœ… Browser compatibility - Added fallback styles and features
3. âœ… GitHub API rate limiting - Implemented response caching
4. [ ] Performance optimization for large server networks
5. [ ] Real-time updates for server status changes

## Future Considerations
1. Server analytics dashboard
2. Batch installation features
3. Custom server templates
4. Integration with CI/CD pipelines
5. Server backup and restore functionality
